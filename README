SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The VCN distribution is intended to be used in conjunction with Drupal 6 and Doctrine 1, and assumes expertise in both systems.  The "drupal" distribution should be installed within Drupal 6, and has been tested and deployed with Drupal 6.25, available here:

http://drupal.org/node/1461656 

The theme installation requires the Zen theme, available at Drupal.org.  The included custom theme "zen_hvcp" is a sub-theme of Zen.

The following contrib modules, also available at Drupal.org, are used.  (Some of these modules, like memcached, are optional, and can be disabled.)
