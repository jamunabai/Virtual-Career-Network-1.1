			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Networking is a crucial element of job hunting because many jobs are never advertised. Employers prefer to interview and hire people referred to them by friends, family, or current employees. This is called the hidden job market.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Everyone networks &mdash; at school, church, social activities, work, and online. It is about helping other people as much as it is about getting people to help you. It also helps connect you with others who share your interests.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Career networking is about talking with people &mdash; formally or informally &mdash; who might know about possible jobs.</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">It is not the same as asking for a job. Usually your networking contacts will not be potential employers.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">It helps you learn inside information about jobs that are being created or not advertised.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">You can use it for ongoing professional and personal development.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">An employer who is not hiring today may be looking for someone like you tomorrow.</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Here are some tips to successful networking.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Be clear about your job search goals</strong></span></span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Think about what you want to say to others about yourself and what you want to know from them.</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">What kind(s) of job(s) are you looking for?</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">What skills and experience prepared you for these jobs?</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Are you focused on a particular industry?</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Do you want to find a job at a particular company?</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Do you want to look for jobs within certain geography?</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<span style="color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Prepare an &quot;elevator speech&quot;</strong></span></span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">An elevator speech is a two-minute description of your skills and career goals. It&#39;s an easy way to share what you want to learn from someone who is in a position to help you. Here&#39;s an example:</span></span></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">&quot;Hi. My name is ____________. I&#39;m looking for _________________ in _______. I really like __________________ . I&#39;m good at ___________________.&quot;</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">When using your elevator speech, don&#39;t be afraid to ask for help. For example, &quot;Do you have any advice for me? Do know anything about this company? Do you know anyone who does know about ______________? Can I use your name to contact them?&quot;</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Make a list of contacts</strong></span></span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Make a list people who might be able to help answer your job search questions. Start talking with them. These contacts might include:</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Friends, family, neighbors, and church members</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Former classmates, teachers, and professors</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Acquaintances and business contacts, including former managers, supervisors, and coworkers</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Referrals from other contacts</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<span style="color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Be prepared and organize your list of contacts</strong></span></span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Some job seekers find it helpful to think about themselves as a business.

Here are a few ways to make sure you create a good first impression and effectively manage your job search:</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Create a simple business card.

			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Organize information about your contacts in a way that is meaningful to you. Then track your ongoing communication with them. Some people use a three-ring binder, tickler file, spreadsheet, or e-mail system.</span></span></li>
			<li>

		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">An informational interview is a meeting with an employer or professional within a specific industry. They are used to learn about the skills, training, and experience needed for an occupation. It&#39;s also a way to learn about a specific company or industry.</span></span></p>

Be sure to mention your networking contact&#39;s name. When you tell someone you will call, be sure to follow up. If they&rsquo;re difficult to reach, keep trying.
