			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Social and career networking sites are the latest tools for job seekers and employers. They can help improve your job search results. If you use them, think about your goals and how to present a professional image.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Why use online networking tools?</strong></span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Online networking helps you learn about industries and companies. You can meet job networking contacts or people who can help you find work. Companies also use these sites to find and check out employees before they decide to interview or hire them.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Networking sites are a great way to market yourself. A professional online identity (profile) can result in career success. But photos in bad taste, use of bad language, and poor spelling can leave employers wondering what type of employee you would be.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>What to know before you log on</strong></span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Some sites let you read discussions and job postings without joining. Most sites only let you see or add content after you&#39;ve created an account. Be careful about what you say about yourself and the items you put online:</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Don&#39;t list personal information or post comments, photos, or videos that you wouldn&#39;t want an employer to see.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Think of everything you put online as public information.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Do an online search of your name to see what information and/or images of you are on the Internet.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Be careful of scams for fake job positions, training, or job search help.</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">For online group discussions, follow these tips:</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Find out if the online group has FAQs (frequently asked questions). Read them before participating.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Stick to the topic.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Limit your response to the current subject.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Don&#39;t change the subject in the middle of the thread.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Begin a new discussion if you want to change the subject.</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Consider when to respond to the group or to a specific individual.</span></span>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
					<li>
						<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Respond to the individual if your reply is personal, off topic, or you want to limit the response.</span></span></li>
					<li>
						<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Respond to the group when your reply is of interest to the group.</span></span></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Which online networking tools should you use?</strong></span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">There are many social tools and networking sites that can help with your job search. Here are a few of the most common ones:</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/nhome/" target="_blank"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a> is a useful site for people in professional jobs. Over 80 million people use it to keep up-to-date about their industry, have discussions, and find job openings. You can use LinkedIn to:</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Create and maintain an online identity. This profile tells an employer your skills, career goals, and work experience.</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Connect with those in your field and other people by adding them to your group of &quot;connections.&quot; Connections may ask for recommendations from each other and share events and trends.</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">Join groups and discussions of interest to you and your career goals. Find <a href="http://learn.linkedin.com/groups/" target="_blank">LinkedIn groups</a> in your industry. Or <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/4710/5-Tips-for-Creating-Promoting-and-Managing-a-LinkedIn-Group.aspx" target="_blank">create your own networking group</a>. Groups are also a good place to ask questions and learn about job leads.</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> is a popular tool for getting to know others and letting them get to know you too. How you use Facebook is your choice.</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">If you use it to stay in touch with friends and family, play online games, and post your pictures, keep your privacy settings as high as possible. Your profile may include a great deal of private information that would be illegal for an employer to ask. Some of it may hurt your chances of landing a job.</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">If you choose to use it for career purposes, it is important to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/kit-eaton/technomix/if-youre-applying-job-censor-your-facebook-page" target="_blank">clean up your profile</a>. Remove any posts, comments, photos, or online games that an employer might not approve of. Also, be careful about which groups you join and how you act online.</span></span></li>
		</ul>

			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> has become a useful tool for job seekers and employers. When you <a href="http://support.twitter.com/articles/226661" target="_blank">follow a Twitter user</a>, you can see their messages (up to 140 characters) called &quot;tweets.&quot; The latest tweet messages will show up at the top of your Twitter page or mobile device. You can search for tweets about job opening or send a link to your resume in a tweet.</span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The key to making Twitter work for you is to use <a href="http://support.twitter.com/articles/223471" target="_blank">hashtags</a>. Hashtags are keywords (words that describe what you are looking for) following the # symbol. They allow Twitter users to &quot;tag&quot; their messages to make searching by a certain topic easier. If you click one of these hashtags in a message, Twitter will pull up all the recent tweets that use those keywords. Common hashtags used for job searches are:</span></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">#jobs</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">#jobhunt</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">#jobsearch</span></span></li>
			<li>
				<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">#unemployment</span></span></li>

			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Blogs</strong> are a common way for people and companies to get information out. Find blogs that keep you up-to-date about your career or industry. You can search for blogs using blog directories, such as <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch" target="_blank">Google&#39;s blog search</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/directory/" target="_blank">Technorati</a>, and <a href="http://www.blogcatalog.com/category/" target="_blank">Blog Catalog</a>.

			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Electronic mailing lists</strong> (sometimes referred to as LISTSERVs) have been around for years. They allow users to send an e-mail message to a group of people all at once. Some are set up as discussion groups and allow people on the list to talk back and forth. Mailing lists are used as a simple way to start discussions or push a message out to a certain group of people. Many <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo Groups</a> have e-mail lists for their members. The best way to find a mailing list of interest to you is to check if your industry has one.</span></span></p>

			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>The networking tools above are just a start.</strong></span></span></p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The online world changes quickly so new tools are popping up all the time. Also, different online resources are popular for different occupations, areas, and industries. As you make choices about online networking tools, remember that employers are using them too. Many employers check profiles on popular networking sites before making interviewing and hiring decisions.</span></span></p>
