<b>Prior Learning</b>, for this section, can be defined as the learning you have gained through training courses, placement exams, and
various military/worklife experiences.  While not all prior learning is usable for college credit, it is possible that
some of your prior training and experience might be applicable.  This could save you time and money, as you pursue the
college courses you need, while bypassing the ones where you already have sufficient experience.
